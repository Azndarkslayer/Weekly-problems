Problem #4: DIGIT PALS

Consider a game played with matrix of M rows and N columns of digits 0...9, for example:

                                   row\col a b c d e
1 3 5 2 2       which is referenced   3:   1 3 5 2 2
2 2 3 5 1       as row,col using      2:   2 2 3 5 1
1 2 3 5 5       indexes shown here:   1:   1 2 3 5 5
The lower left corner is 1a and the upper right corner is 3e.
This game involves removing sets of digits from the matrix according to the following rules:

'Digit pals' are digits of the same value which are '4-connected' (adjacent either up/down or right/left; diagonal adjacency is not considered to be 4-connected). You pick a digit and remove it and all its pals and all their pals, etc. Isolated digits (those without pals) cannot be removed. In the example above, the 1Õs are currently all isolated and cannot be removed. You can remove two sets of digit pals that contain the digit 2 and one each digit pals containing 3 or 5.
When you remove digits from a column, all the digits Ôslide downÕ to stack nicely at the bottom of the column. See the examples below.
If there is an empty column, i.e., the bottom row of that column is blank, the column is deleted and all the columns to its right slide left (as many times as necessary) to fill in the gap. The matrix might have new neighbors and perhaps new pals or might be completely empty.
The object is to remove all the pals and be left with an empty matrix. If you are left with a non-empty matrix of isolated digits, you lose the game.
For example, if you are facing
1 2
2 1
then you lose the game.

Here is an example of a win using the 15 element matrix above.

First select 3e and remove the digit 2 pals:

1 3 5
2 2 3 5 1
1 2 3 5 5
Next, select 2b and remove the remaining digit 2 pals. The 3 slides down:

    5
1   3 5 1
1 3 3 5 5
Next, select 1b and remove the digit 3 pals. The 5 flows down and the right-hand three columns slide to the left.

1   5 1
1 5 5 5
Next select 1c (or 1b or 2c) to take out the digit 5 pals:

1
1 1
Finally, select 1a to empty the grid. You win! There were several different ways to show the sequence of plays to win this game.

Given sets of matrices, print an ordered sequence of regions to be removed that will win the game or print "NO WIN". If there are multiple sequences that win the game, you need print only one.

Input specifications:

The first line of the input file is two integers representing the number of rows and number of columns. On each subsequent line, the numbers in the matrix are listed in column order starting at column a. The sample input shows the example discussed above.

The matrix will contain no more than 60 rows and no more than 26 columns. It is not promised that it is possible to write a program that can solve a large case within the alloted time limit.

Sample input:

3 5
1 3 5 2 2
2 2 3 5 1
1 2 3 5 5
Sample output:

3e 2b 1b 1c 1a
